Task 1: Configure a DHCP Scope
Steps:
Open DHCP Management Console:

Go to SERVER1.
Open the DHCP Management Console (DHCP Manager).
Create a New DHCP Scope:

Right-click on the IPv4 node and select New Scope.
Name the scope scope-lastname-group (replace "lastname" with your own last name).
Define the IP address range for the scope. For example, set a starting IP address and an ending IP address.
Configure Scope Options:

Add the IP address of the DNS server already present in the domain.
Add the same IP address of the DNS server as the IP address for the router (default gateway).
Activate the Scope:

Complete the wizard to activate the scope.
Take a Screenshot:

Ensure the scope details and configurations are visible.
Take a screenshot without cropping.
Concepts:
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
DHCP Scope: A range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign to clients.
DNS Server Option: Specifies the IP address of the DNS server that clients should use.
Default Gateway: The IP address of the router that clients use to communicate outside the local network.
Task 2: Configure Another DHCP Scope
Steps:
Open DHCP Management Console:

Go to SERVER1.
Open the DHCP Management Console (DHCP Manager).
Create a New DHCP Scope:

Right-click on the IPv4 node and select New Scope.
Name the scope other scope-lastname group (replace "lastname" with your own last name).
Define the IP address range for the scope.
Leave DHCP Options Empty:

Skip the DHCP options configuration steps.
Complete the wizard to activate the scope.
Take a Screenshot:

Ensure the scope details and configurations are visible.
Take a screenshot without cropping.
Concepts:
DHCP Options: Additional parameters (like DNS server, gateway, etc.) that can be provided to clients. In this case, they are left empty.
Task 3: Configure DHCP Failover
Steps:
Open DHCP Management Console:

Go to SERVER1.
Open the DHCP Management Console (DHCP Manager).
Configure Failover for Scopes:

Right-click on the scope-lastname-group scope and select Configure Failover.
Select Add Scope and then select other scope-lastname group.
Choose SERVER2 as the partner server.
Set the load balancing mode to distribute 60% of the load to SERVER1.
Ensure the shared secret is not used.
Complete the Configuration:

Complete the failover configuration wizard.
Take a Screenshot:

Ensure the failover settings are visible.
Take a screenshot without cropping.

SQL

Install SQL Server on SERVER1 and SERVER2:

Ensure that SQL Server is installed on both servers with the same instance name.
Enable AlwaysOn Availability Groups:

Open SQL Server Configuration Manager on SERVER1 and SERVER2.
Go to SQL Server Services.
Right-click on the SQL Server instance and select Properties.
Go to the AlwaysOn High Availability tab.
Check the box to enable AlwaysOn Availability Groups.
Restart the SQL Server service.
Configure a Windows Failover Cluster:

Open Failover Cluster Manager on SERVER1.
Create a new cluster and add SERVER1 and SERVER2 as nodes.
Validate the cluster configuration.
Name the cluster (e.g., "SQLCluster") and assign a cluster IP address.
Create a Screenshot:

Ensure the configuration details are visible.
Take a screenshot without cropping.

Task 2: Create Databases and Configure Availability Groups
LO3_M (3 points)
Steps:

Create Databases on SERVER1:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on SERVER1.
Connect to the SQL Server instance.
Create two new databases named midterm2DB1 and midterm2DB2.
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE midterm2DB1;
CREATE DATABASE midterm2DB2;
Configure Availability Group for midterm2DB1:

In SSMS, right-click on the AlwaysOn High Availability node and select New Availability Group Wizard.
Name the availability group (e.g., AG_midterm2DB1).
Select midterm2DB1 as the database to add.
Configure the secondary replica (SERVER2) and set the availability mode.
Choose the backup preference and configure the listener if needed.
Complete the wizard.
Configure Availability Group for midterm2DB2:

Repeat the steps above to create another availability group for midterm2DB2.
Ensure that SQL Server creates a full and log backup before sharing it across to SERVER2.
Create a Screenshot:

Ensure the availability group configurations are visible.
Take a screenshot without cropping.
Task 3: Other Methods of Making an SQL Server Highly Available
LO3_D (3 points)

Methods of High Availability for SQL Server:

Database Mirroring:

Description: Maintains a copy of the database on a standby server.
Benefits:
Provides high availability and disaster recovery.
Automatic failover in high-safety mode.
Drawbacks:
Deprecated in favor of AlwaysOn Availability Groups.
Requires manual intervention for failover in high-performance mode.
Log Shipping:

Description: Automatically sends transaction log backups from one server to another.
Benefits:
Simple to set up and manage.
Provides a warm standby server.
Drawbacks:
No automatic failover; requires manual intervention.
Data loss possible as it relies on log backups.
Replication:

Description: Distributes data across multiple servers using different replication methods (Snapshot, Transactional, Merge).
Benefits:
Allows data distribution and redundancy.
Flexible topology options.
Drawbacks:
Complex setup and management.
Potential latency issues with data synchronization.
Failover Clustering:

Description: Uses Windows Server Failover Clustering to provide high availability at the instance level.
Benefits:
Provides automatic failover.
No data loss during failover.
Drawbacks:
Requires shared storage (SAN or iSCSI).
Higher cost and complexity.
