### Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) Overview

Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) is a feature in Windows Server that allows you to create a highly available and scalable storage system using local storage from multiple servers.
S2D aggregates the local storage (e.g., HDDs, SSDs) into a single, highly resilient pool. This pool can then be used to create virtual disks, or volumes, which are spread across the nodes for redundancy and performance.

"cluster" refers to a group of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together to provide continuous availability and reliability for applications.
The main goals are to ensure that the system remains operational even if one or more nodes fail and to distribute workloads efficiently.


### Steps Breakdown

#### Setting Things Up

1. *VMs Setup:*
    
    - *SERVERDC*: This VM acts as the domain controller.
    - *SERVER1 and SERVER2*: These VMs will be configured as nodes in the S2D cluster.
2. *Reverting to Domain Snapshot:*
    
    - Ensure that all VMs are in a known, good state by reverting to a snapshot where they are all part of the domain.
3. *Starting VMs:*
    
    - Boot up SERVERDC, SERVER1, and SERVER2.
4. *Installing Failover Clustering:*
    
    - On SERVER1 and SERVER2, install the Failover Clustering feature, which is necessary to create and manage the cluster.

#### Configuration

1. *Install Failover Clustering on SERVER1 and SERVER2:*
    
    - Redundant step from setup, ensuring both servers are ready for clustering.
2. *Login and Start Failover Cluster Manager:*
    
    - Log in as a domain admin on one of the node servers (either SERVER1 or SERVER2) and open Failover Cluster Manager to manage the cluster.
3. *Validate SERVER1 and SERVER2:*
    
    - Run the cluster validation wizard to ensure SERVER1 and SERVER2 meet the requirements to form a cluster.
4. *Create a New Cluster:*
    
    - Create a new cluster named VSAN, assigning it an IP address from the same subnet. Initially, do not add any disks to the cluster.
5. *Enable Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) using PowerShell:*
    
    - Execute the command: Enable-ClusterS2D -autoconfig:0 -poolfriendlyname VSANcluster -cachestate:0
    - This configures S2D, naming the pool "VSANcluster" and disabling caching.
6. *Verify Configuration:*
    
    - Use PowerShell to verify the configuration: get-storagesubsystem *cluster* | get-storagepool | get-physicaldisk
    - This command checks the storage subsystem, storage pool, and physical disks.
7. *Create a New Storage Pool in Failover Cluster Manager:*
    
    - Create a new storage pool named VSANpool using all the available disks from the VSAN cluster.
8. *Create Volumes using PowerShell:*
    
    - Create two volumes within the VSANpool:
        - get-storagepool VSANpool | New-volume -FriendlyName vsanVOL1 -Size 20GB
        - get-storagepool VSANpool | New-volume -FriendlyName vsanVOL2 -Size 10GB
9. *Assign Drive Letters:*
    
    - Assign drive letters V: and W: to the newly created volumes. Change the owner nodes as necessary to ensure both servers can access the volumes and assign drive letters.
10. *Take a Screenshot:*
    

- Capture the details of the volumes in Failover Cluster Manager (FCM) and the disks in Windows Explorer on the owner node.

11. *Simulate Node Failure:*

- Power off the owner node and observe the changes in the cluster. Describe how the volumes are handled by the remaining node.

#### Prepare for the Next Lab

- Revert all SERVER VMs to the Domain snapshot to reset the environment for the next lab session.
